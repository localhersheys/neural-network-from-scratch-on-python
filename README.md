# neural-network-from-scratch-on-python
Neural network is a way of machine learning modelled (somewhat) on the human brain (hence gaining the "neural" in its name). Nowadays, it's easy to train a model with a neural network with the help of publicly available and easy-to-use libraries with choices on the number of hidden layers, the number of nodes in those layers, and the activation functions, among other things.


So what's the use of making one from scratch, you say? 
While relying on these libraries, we often end up ignoring the crucial concepts and the reasoning behind the attributes we give. Therefore, as a learner of machine learning, I thought the best way to learn about neural networks in detail was to build one.

The neural network I've built is a simple one. It's a digit recognizer with three layers. The first layer is the input layer that takes 784 inputs (the values of 784 pixels from a 28x28 image). The second one is the only hidden layer with 10 nodes, and the output layer again contains 10 nodes for the 10 digits (0 to 9).

I've put a comment on all the functions explaining their workings.


It was really fun working on it, fun enough to prompt me to take up some more complex versions of this in the future, and I'd really encourage anyone wanting to get into ML to try it.

thank you for reading all of that monologue :P

see you another time, byee
